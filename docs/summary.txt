# Derby Director Implementation - Phase 1 Summary

## Project Structure
We've created a modular, organized codebase with clear separation of concerns:

```

├── api/                    # API package
│   ├── controllers/        # API route handlers
│   ├── models/             # Database models
│   ├── schemas/            # Pydantic schemas

│   │   └── timer/          # Timer integration
│   └── middleware/         # Authentication middleware
├── config.py               # Configuration
└── main.py                 # Application entry point
```

## Key Components Implemented

### Database Models
- Racer - Representing derby participants
- Division - Divisions for organizing racers
- Rank - Optional categorization within divisions
- Car - Details about each racer's vehicle
- Round - Competition rounds (e.g., preliminary, final)
- Heat - Individual races within rounds
- RaceResult - Times and places for each lane
- Award - Types of awards that can be given
- Settings - Application configuration

### API Controllers
- AuthController - User authentication
- RacerController - Racer management
- DivisionController - Division management
- HeatController - Heat scheduling and management
- ResultController - Race result recording and retrieval

### Services
- TimerService - Core interface for hardware timer integration

- SmartLineTimer - Support for SmartLine timer hardware
- FastTrackTimer - Support for FastTrack timer hardware

### API Features
- Modern RESTful API design
- JWT authentication and authorization
- API documentation with OpenAPI
- CORS support for frontend integration
- Proper error handling and validation

## Built With
- Litestar - Fast, modern async Python API framework
- SQLAlchemy - Powerful ORM with async support

## Next Steps

### Phase 2 - Vue Frontend
- Create Vue 3 frontend application
- Implement components for racers, heats, results
- Build live race dashboard
- Create responsive UI design for various devices

### Phase 3 - Electron Packaging
- Package the application for desktop use
- Configure the app to launch the API server
- Implement direct hardware access for timer connections
- Create offline capabilities
